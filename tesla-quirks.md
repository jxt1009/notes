## 1 Preface
Read the [Owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/). It has a ton of important information and quirks. There's more features than you can imagine, so it'll let you know how to make the most of your car
## 2 General
### 2.1 Turn Signals
I enjoy the steering wheel turn signals, but it takes some getting used to. 
The best advice I got was to turn on your signal earlier than needed so you have more time to remember where it is. 
It doesn't take long to get the hang of it.

### 2.2 Auto wipers
This is the one feature of Teslas that's surprisingly poor. We use cameras to assess the amount of water on your windshield, and it's notoriously bad at doing so. I still use them, but you have to work with them for the best experience. 
#### 2.2.1 How to make them work
Pressing the wiper button on the steering wheel will do a single wipe. This sometimes is enough for the system to realize its raining and start working.
Most times, you have to hit the wiper button twice. Once the car sees that, it kicks into action and starts wiping at a normal rate. 

The other annoying part is that once they start working, they often continue running at a fast rate even when the rain slows down or stops entirely. 

### 2.3 Park Assist (Vision)
The car uses the cameras to understand the world around you. It's very good, just be cautious. It's tolerance is close but not exact, **so if you feel like the car isn't seeing something (like a curb), trust your instinct.** 

### 2.4 Wifi
Hopefully your parking spot at home is close enough for you to get a Wifi signal. This is important for the car to get software updates. 
You can also use a phone hostpot, but it can be pretty slow to download the updates. 

### 2.5 Unlock button
I mention this because it can be confusing when you pull up to pick someone up in your car (like at the airport), and since your car isn't in park, the doors are locked. 

Most cars have a physical button to unlock the doors. With Teslas, it's in the screen (of course). It's the lock icon at the top of the screen, usually in the middle. Tap it to unlock the doors.

### 2.6 Climate
#### 2.6.1 Auto Climate
The automatic climate control is awesome. I leave everything (fan speed, heated/cooled seats, heated steering wheel, recirculation) on auto. Then all you need to do is change the temperature and everything else reacts to make it as comfortable as possible. 
#### 2.6.2 Preconditioning
It's best practice to use the Tesla App to wake the car up and turn the climate on before you drive. The car will remember your last set interior temperature and make sure it's comfortable before you get in.
This also preps the battery for the drive. It'll still be fine if you don't do this, but it may help battery health over the life of the car. 

And when it's cold, it'll also automatically turn on the defrosters to make sure your windows are defogged and clear by the time you get in.

### 2.7 Charging
#### 2.7.1 Supercharging
Supercharging is a luxury/convenience feature. Thus it's not intended to be your main way of charging and is priced as such. If you can spend some time at a slower charger, it'll be more affordable and better on your battery health

#### 2.7.2 Preconditioning
Supercharging requires your car's battery to be conditioned for the full charging speed. The only way to do this is to navigate to the charger using the car's navigation. 
When you navigate to a supercharger, you will hear and feel the car getting ready. The car will start pumping coolant through the battery at the necessary temperature to try and warm or cool the battery. 

>[!WARNING]
>If you do not precondition, your supercharging session will be MUCH longer. 
>The car will have to spend the first 10-15 minutes prepping the battery rather than charging.
>This means your car will only charge at ~20% speed until the battery is ready

#### 2.7.3 Charge Indicator
The charge info in the car display and in the app can be set to miles or percentage.
This is best to leave as percent of battery remaining. While the car is fairly accurate at giving you a mileage estimate, it can cause anxiety to see the miles remaining. Percentage is a simpler way to keep track of your charge.
#### 2.7.4 Third Party Chargers
I'd highly recommend getting the [PlugShare](https://www.plugshare.com/) app. There's a large network of other non-Tesla chargers that can be convenient to use. These are typically at restaurants and shopping plazas and are a great way to top up your car for cheap while you're already spending time around them.

### 2.8 Auto Open Trunk
Auto open trunk is great, but it can be a little tedious. Make sure to stand right behind the car with your phone in your pocket. If you're in the right spot, it'll start beeping and flashing the lights. After three beeps, it'll open.
This can be a slight annoyance sometimes if you are doing something else behind the car. If it thinks you're trying to open the trunk when you don't want it, just step away for a moment.

### 2.9 AutoShift
This is a great feature. You can enable it in the car settings. It's not perfect but it does a good job saving you from having to shift with the screen.

### 2.10 Car Wash Mode
This feature is a bit annoying when you use a drive-through car wash. I still haven't entirely figured out the best way to get it into car wash mode while entering the wash.
The car wants to be in park to enter car wash mode, so it can be problematic when you're on the conveyor belt style car wash. 
You need to hit the "Enter Car Wash Mode" button under the Service menu in the car settings, and then hit neutral on the ceiling gear selector (up by the lights near your rear view mirror).

## 3 FSD
### 3.1 Gas Pedal
It's good to know that you can have some input into the car even when its self-driving. 
When you're in a parking lot, it's usually over-cautious and drives super slow. You can lightly press the pedal to get the car to go at a normal speed.

This also helps at stop signs. The NHTSA required FSD to come to a complete stop, but this can annoy or confuse other drivers around you. Pressing the pedal lightly will push the car to start moving more quickly.

>[!NOTE]
>The car displays a message that it won't brake while you're hitting the accelerator. 
>Be cautious, but this does help smooth out some of the quirks with FSD

### 3.2 Turn signals w/ FSD
When using FSD, you can change lanes by using the turn signal. 
In addition, if you feel FSD is not making a smart lane change or a turn, you can hit the turn signal to cancel. 

>[!NOTE]
>This is more of a suggestion to the FSD system. The car can choose to ignore your input if it feels it's making the right choice. 

## 4 End of drive
FSD is still learning what to do when it gets to a destination. It sometimes pulls right up to the front of your destination and goes into park. Other times, it may try to find a parking space.

For the most part, it's good to disengage FSD when you're pulling up to your destination and manually park the car. 

### 4.1 Summon
Summon is awesome but there's some quirks. First, it is still called 'Supervised' so you need to keep an eye on it. I haven't had issues but others have had the car scrape a wheel on the curb.

The button in the app is called a "dead man switch". This means you must hold it at all times while the car is moving. Releasing your finger will cause the car to slam on the brakes and park exactly where it is. This is for safety, but can be a bit tricky.

The car also moves fairly slowly. I wouldn't use this during a rush hour period as other drivers may get annoyed.

#### 4.1.1 Summon Radius
The app will show a circle radius around the car. You need to be in this radius for summon to be available. More importantly, this radius moves with the car. And it's common for California parking lots to have one-way rows. 

So sometimes the car needs to drive away from you to get to your location. This can cause a situation where the car moves too far away from you and goes out-of-range. That means the car will immediately stop and shut off, likely right in the middle of the parking lot lane.
